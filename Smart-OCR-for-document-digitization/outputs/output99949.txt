Lets Bridge the Gap

Program Description:

In this course, we will start with a theoretical understanding of simple Python, OpenCV,
Computer Vision, neural nets and gradually move to Deep Neural Nets and
Convolutional Neural Networks.

Artificial Intelligence (Al) is that wave sweeping the technology world today. If you want
to join this revolution but do not have the skills yet, this series of courses are right for
you.

In addition to the development of machine learning that leads to new capabilities, we
have subsets within the domain of machine learning, each of which offers a potential
area of specialization for those interested in a career in Al.

e Neural Networks
Neural networks are integral for teaching computers to think and learn by
classifying information, similar to how we as humans learn. With neural networks,
the software can learn to recognize images, for example. Machines can also
make predictions and decisions with a high level of accuracy based on data
inputs.

e Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Natural language processing gives machines the ability to understand human
language. As this develops, machines will learn to respond in a way a human
audience can understand. In the future, this will dramatically change how we
interface with all computers.

e Deep Learning
Deep learning is at the cutting-edge of intelligent automation. It focuses on
machine learning tools and deploying them to solve problems by making
decisions. With deep learning, data is processed through neural networks,
getting closer to how we think as humans. Deep learning can be applied to
images, text, and speech to draw conclusions that mimic human decision
making.

We'll be exploring how to use Python and the OpenCV (Open Computer Vision) library
to analyse images and video data.

Lets Bridge the Gap

The most popular platforms in the world are generating never before seen amounts of
image and video data. Now more than ever it’s necessary for developers to gain the
necessary skills to work with image and video data using computer vision.

Computer vision allows us to analyse and leverage image and video data, with
applications in a variety of industries, Social Distancing, including self-driving cars,
social network apps, medical diagnostics, and many more.

As the fastest growing language in popularity, Python is well suited to leverage the
power of existing computer vision libraries to learn from all this image and video data.

We'll start the course by learning about numerical processing with the NumPy library
and how to open and manipulate images with NumPy. Then will move on to using the
OpenCV library to open and work with image basics. Then we'll start to understand how
to process images and videos.

Then we'll move on to understanding video basics with OpenCV, including working with
streaming video from a webcam. Afterwards we'll learn about direct video topics, such
as optical flow and object detection. Including face detection and object tracking.

Then we'll move on to an entire section of the course devoted to the latest deep learning
topics, including image recognition and custom image classifications. We'll even cover
the latest deep learning networks, including the YOLO (you only look once) deep
learning network, Fast R-CNN, Retina-NET, Mask R-CNN, Single Shot Detector.

This course covers all this and more, including the following topics:

NumPy

Images with NumPy

Image and Video Basics with NumPy
Streaming video with OpenCV
Object Detection

Template Matching

Corner, Edge, and Grid Detection
Contour Detection

Feature Matching

Object Tracking

Optical Flow

Deep Learning with Keras

Keras and Convolutional Networks
Customized Deep Learning Networks
State of the Art YOLO Networks and much more!
