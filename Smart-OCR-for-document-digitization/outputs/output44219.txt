Lets Bridge the Gap

Program Description:

In this course, we will start with a theoretical understanding of simple Python, OpenCV,
Computer Vision, neural nets and gradually move to Deep Neural Nets and
Convolutional Neural Networks.

Artificial Intelligence (Al) is that wave sweeping the technology world today. If you want
to join this revolution but do not have the skills yet, this series of courses are right for
you.

In addition to the development of machine learning that leads to new capabilities, we
have subsets within the domain of machine learning, each of which offers a potential
area of specialization for those interested in a career in Al.

e Neural Networks
Neural networks are integral for teaching computers to think and learn by
classifying information, similar to how we as humans learn. With neural networks,
the software can learn to recognize images, for example. Machines can also
make predictions and decisions with a high level of accuracy based on data
inputs.

e Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Natural language processing gives machines the ability to understand human
language. As this develops, machines will learn to respond in a way a human
audience can understand. In the future, this will dramatically change how we
interface with all computers.

e Deep Learning
Deep learning is at the cutting-edge of intelligent automation. It focuses on
machine learning tools and deploying them to solve problems by making
decisions. With deep learning, data is processed through neural networks,
getting closer to how we think as humans. Deep learning can be applied to
images, text, and speech to draw conclusions that mimic human decision
making.

We'll be exploring how to use Python and the OpenCV (Open Computer Vision) library
to analyse images and video data.
